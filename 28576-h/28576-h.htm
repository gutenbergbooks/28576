WHY I QUIT</h2>


<p>First off, let me state the object
of the meeting: This is
to be a record of sundry experiences
centering round a stern resolve
to get on the waterwagon
and a sterner attempt to stay there.
It is an entirely personal narrative
of a strictly personal set of circumstances.
It is not a temperance lecture,
or a temperance tract, or a
chunk of advice, or a shuddering
recital of the woes of a horrible example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
or a warning, or an admonition&mdash;or
anything at all but a plain
tale of an adventure that started
out rather vaguely and wound up
rather satisfactorily.</p>

<p>I am no brand that was snatched
from the burning; no sot who
picked himself or was picked from
the gutter; no drunkard who almost
wrecked a promising career;
no constitutional or congenital
souse. I drank liquor the same
way hundreds of thousands of men
drink it&mdash;drank liquor and attended
to my business, and got along
well, and kept my health, and provided
for my family, and maintained
my position in the community.
I felt I had a perfect right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to drink liquor just as I had a perfect
right to stop drinking it. I
never considered my drinking in
any way immoral.</p>

<p>I was decent, respectable, a gentleman,
who drank only with gentlemen
and as a gentleman should
drink if he pleases. I didn't care
whether any one else drank&mdash;and
do not now. I didn't care whether
any one else cared whether I drank&mdash;and
do not now. I am no reformer,
no lecturer, no preacher. I quit
because I wanted to, not because
I had to. I didn't swear off, nor
take any vow, nor sign any pledge.
I am no moral censor. It is even
possible that I might go out this
afternoon and take a drink. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
quite sure I shall not&mdash;but I might.
As far as my trip into Teetotal
Land is concerned, it is an individual
proposition and nothing else. I
am no example for other men who
drink as much as I did, or more,
or less&mdash;but I assume my experiences
are somewhat typical, for I
am sure my drinking was very typical;
and a recital of those experiences
and the conclusions thereon
is what is before the house.</p>

<p>I quit drinking because I quit
drinking. I had a very fair batting
average in the Booze League&mdash;as
good as I thought necessary; and
I knew if I stopped when my record
was good the situation would
be satisfactory to me, whether it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
was to any other person or not.
Moreover, I figured it out that the
time to stop drinking was when it
wasn't necessary to stop&mdash;not when
it was necessary. I had been observing
during the twenty years
I had been drinking, more or less,
and I had known a good many men
who stopped drinking when the
doctors told them to. Furthermore,
it had been my observation that
when a doctor tells a man to stop
drinking it usually doesn't make
much difference whether he stops
or not. In a good many cases he
might just as well keep on and die
happily, for he's going to die anyhow;
and the few months he will
grab through his abstinence will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
not amount to anything when the
miseries of that abstinence are duly
chalked up in the debit column.</p>

<p>Therefore, applying the cold,
hard logic of the situation to it,
I decided to beat the liquor to it.</p>

<p>That was the reason for stopping&mdash;purely
selfish, personal, individual,
and not concerned with
the welfare of any other person on
earth&mdash;just myself. I had taken
good care of myself physically and
I knew I was sound everywhere. I
wasn't sure how long I could keep
sound and continue drinking. So
I decided to stop drinking and keep
sound. I noticed that a good many
men of the same age as myself and
the same habits as myself were beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to show signs of wear and
tear. A number of them blew up
with various disconcerting maladies
and a number more died. Soon
after I was forty years of age I
noticed I began to go to funerals
oftener than I had been doing&mdash;funerals
of men between forty and
forty-five I had known socially and
convivially; that these funerals occurred
quite regularly, and that
the doctor's certificate, more times
than not, gave Bright's Disease and
other similar diseases in the cause-of-death
column. All of these funerals
were of men who were good
fellows, and we mourned their
loss. Also we generally took a few
drinks to their memories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came a time when this funeral
business landed on me like
a pile-driver. Inside of a year four
or five of the men I had known
best, the men I had loved best, the
men who had been my real friends
and my companions, died, one after
another. Also some other friends
developed physical derangements I
knew were directly traceable to too
much liquor. Both the deaths and
the derangements had liquor as
a contributing if not as a direct
cause. Nobody said that, of course;
but I knew it.</p>

<p>So I held a caucus with myself.
I called myself into convention and
discussed the proposition somewhat
like this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are now over forty years
of age. You are sound physically
and you are no weaker mentally
than you have always been, so far
as can be discovered by the outside
world. You have had a lot
of fun, much of it complicated with
the conviviality that comes with
drinking and much of it not so complicated;
but you have done your
share of plain and fancy drinking,
and it hasn't landed you yet. There
is absolutely no nutriment in being
dead. That gets you nothing save
a few obituary notices you will
never see. There is even less in
being sick and sidling around in
everybody's way. It's as sure as
sunset, if you keep on at your present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
gait, that Mr. John Barleycorn
will land you just as he has landed
a lot of other people you know and
knew. There are two methods of
procedure open to you. One is to
keep it up and continue having the
fun you think you are having and
take what is inevitably coming to
you. The other is to quit it while
the quitting is good and live a few
more years&mdash;that may not be so
rosy, but probably will have compensations."</p>

<p>I viewed it from every angle I
could think of. I knew what sort
of a job I had laid out to tackle if
I quit. I weighed the whole thing
in my mind in the light of my acquaintances,
my experiences, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
position, my mode of life, my business.
I had been through it many
times. I had often gone on the
waterwagon for periods varying
in length from three days to three
months. I wasn't venturing into
any uncharted territory. I knew
every signpost, every crossroad,
every foot of the ground. I knew
the difficulties&mdash;knew them by
heart. I wasn't deluding myself
with any assertions of superior
will-power or superior courage&mdash;or
superior anything. I knew I
had a fixed daily habit of drinking,
and that if I quit drinking I
should have to reorganize the entire
works.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br /><br />

HOW I QUIT</h2>


<p>This took some time. I didn't
dash into it. I had done that
before, and had dashed out again
just as impetuously. I revolved
the matter in my mind for some
weeks. Then I decided to quit.
Then I did quit. Thereby hangs
this tale.</p>

<p>I went to a dinner one night that
was a good dinner. It was a dinner
that had every appurtenance
that a good dinner should have, including
the best things to drink
that could be obtained, and lashings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of them. I proceeded at that
dinner just as I had proceeded at
scores of similar dinners in my time&mdash;hundreds
of them, I guess&mdash;and
took a drink every time anybody
else did. I was a seasoned drinker.
I knew how to do it. I went home
that night pleasantly jingled, but
no more. I slept well, ate a good
breakfast and went down to business.
On the way down I decided
that this was the day to make the
plunge. Having arrived at that
decision, I went out about three
o'clock that afternoon, drank a
Scotch highball&mdash;a big, man's-sized
one&mdash;as a doch-an-doris, and quit.
That was almost a year ago. I
haven't taken a drink since. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
not my present intention ever to
take another drink; but I am not
tying myself down by any vows.
It is not my present intention, I
say; and I let it go at that.</p>

<p>No man can be blamed for trying
to fool other people about himself&mdash;that
is the way most of us
get past; but what can be said for
a man who tries to fool himself?
Every man knows exactly how
bogus he is and should admit it&mdash;to
himself only. The man who,
knowing his bogusness, refuses to
admit it to himself&mdash;no matter
what his attitude may be to the
outside world&mdash;simply stores up
trouble for himself, and discomfort
and much else. There are many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
phases of personal understanding
of oneself that need not be put in
the newspapers or proclaimed publicly.
Still, for a man to gold-brick
himself is a profitless undertaking,
but prevalent notwithstanding.</p>

<p>When it comes to fooling oneself
by oneself, the grandest performers
are the boys who have a habit&mdash;no
matter what kind of a habit&mdash;a
habit! It may be smoking cigarettes,
or walking pigeontoed, or
talking through the nose, or drinking&mdash;or
anything else. Any man
can see with half an eye how drinking,
for example, is hurting Jones;
but he always argues that his own
personal drinking is of a different
variety and is doing him no harm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
The best illustration of it is in the
old vaudeville story, where the man
came on the stage and said: "Smith
is drinking too much! I never go
into a saloon without finding him
there!"</p>

<p>That is the reason drinking liquor
gets so many people&mdash;either by
wrecking their health or by fastening
on them the habit they cannot
stop. They fool themselves. They
are perfectly well aware that their
neighbors are drinking too much&mdash;but
not themselves. Far be it from
them not to have the will-power to
stop when it is time to stop. They
are smarter than their neighbors.
They know what they are doing.
And suddenly the explosions come!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>There are hundreds of thousands
of men in all walks of life in this
country who for twenty or thirty
years have never lived a minute
when there was not more or less
alcohol in their systems, who cannot
be said to have been strictly
and entirely sober in all that time,
but who do their work, perform all
their social duties, make their careers
and are fairly successful just
the same.</p>

<p>There has been more flub-dub
printed and spoken about drinking
liquor than about any other
employment, avocation, vocation,
habit, practice or pleasure of mankind.
Drinking liquor is a personal
proposition, and nothing else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
It is individual in every human relation.
Still, you cannot make the
reformers see that. They want
other people to stop drinking because
they want other people to
stop. So they make laws that are
violated, and get pledges that are
broken and try to legislate or
preach or coax or scare away a
habit that must, in any successful
outcome, be stopped by the individual,
and not because of any law
or threat or terror or cajolery.</p>

<p>This is the human-nature side of
it, but the professional reformers
know less about human nature, and
care less, than about any other
phase of life. Still, the fact remains
that with any habit, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
with the liquor habit&mdash;probably
because that is the most
prevalent habit there is&mdash;nine-tenths
of the subjects delude themselves
about how much of a habit
they have; and, second, that nine-tenths
of those with the habit have
a very clear idea of the extent to
which the habit is fastened on
others. They are fooled about
themselves, but never about their
neighbors! Wherefore the breweries
and the distilleries prosper
exceedingly.</p>

<p>However, I am straying away
from my story, which has to do
with such drinking as the ordinary
man does&mdash;not sprees, nor debauches,
or orgies, or periodicals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
or drunkenness, but just the ordinary
amount of drinking that happens
along in a man's life, with a
little too much on rare occasions
and plenty at all times. A German
I knew once told me the difference
between Old-World drinking and
American drinking was that the
German, for example, drinks for
the pleasure of the drink, while the
American drinks for the alcohol in
it. That may be so; but very few
men who have any sense or any
age set out deliberately to get
drunk. Such drunkenness as there
is among men of that sort usually
comes more by accident than by
design.</p>

<p>My definition of a drunkard has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
always been this: A man is a drunkard
when he drinks whisky or any
other liquor before breakfast. I
think that is pretty nearly right.
Personally I never took a drink of
liquor before breakfast in my life
and not many before noon. Usually
my drinking began in the afternoon
after business, and was likely to
end before dinnertime&mdash;not always,
but usually.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br /><br />

WHAT I QUIT</h2>


<p>I had been drinking thus for
practically twenty years. I did
not drink at all until after I was
twenty-one and not much until
after I was twenty-five. When I
got to be thirty-two or thirty-three
and had gone along a little in the
world, I fell in with men of my own
station; and as I lived in a town
where nearly everybody drank, including
many of the successful
business and professional men&mdash;men
of affairs&mdash;I soon got into
their habits. Naturally gregarious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
I found these men good company.
They were sociable and convivial,
and drank for the fun of it and the
fun that came out of it.</p>

<p>My business took me to various
parts of the country and I made acquaintances
among men like these&mdash;the
real live ones in the communities.
They were good fellows. So
was I. The result was that in a
few years I had a list of friends
from California to Maine&mdash;all of
whom drank; and I was never at
a loss for company or highballs.
Then I moved to a city where there
isn't much of anything else to do
but drink at certain times in the
day, a city where men from all
parts of the country congregate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and where the social side of life is
highly accentuated. I kept along
with the procession. I did my work
satisfactorily to my employers and
I did my drinking satisfactorily to
myself.</p>

<p>This continued for several years.
I had a fixed habit. I drank several
drinks each day. Sometimes
I drank more than several. My
system was organized to digest
about so much alcohol every
twenty-four hours. So far as I
could see, the drinking did me no
harm. I was well. My appetite
was good. I slept soundly. My
head was clear. My work proceeded
easily and was getting fair recognition.
Then some of the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
began dropping off and some began
breaking down. I had occasional
mornings, after big dinners or specially
convivial affairs, when I did
not feel very well&mdash;when I was out
of tune and knew why. Still, I
continued as of old, and thought
nothing of it except as the regular
katzenjammer&mdash;to be expected.</p>

<p>Presently I woke up to what was
happening round me. I looked the
game over critically. I analyzed it
coldly and calmly. I put every advantage
of my mode of life on one
side and every disadvantage; and
I put on the other side every disadvantage
of a change in procedure
and every advantage. There were
times when I thought the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
mode had by far the better of it,
and times when the change contemplated
outweighed the other
heavily.</p>

<p>Here is the way it totted up
against quitting: Practically every
friend you have in the United
States&mdash;and you've got a lot of
them&mdash;drinks more or less. You
have not cultivated any other line
of associates. If you quit drinking,
you will necessarily have to
quit a lot of these friends, and quit
their parties and company&mdash;for a
man who doesn't drink is always a
death's-head at a feast or merrymaking
where drinking is going on.
Your social intercourse with these
people is predicated on taking an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
occasional drink, in going to places
where drinks are served, both public
and at homes. The kind of
drinking you do makes greatly for
sociability, and you are a sociable
person and like to be round with
congenial people. You will miss a
lot of fun, a lot of good, clever companionship,
for you are too old to
form a new line of friends. Your
whole game is organized along
these lines. Why make a hermit
of yourself just because you think
drinking may harm you? Cut it
down. Take care of yourself. Don't
be such a fool as to try to change
your manner of living just when
you have an opportunity to live as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
you should and enjoy what is coming
to you.</p>

<p>This is the way it lined up for
quitting: So far, liquor hasn't done
anything to you except cause you
to waste some time that might have
been otherwise employed; but it
will get you, just as it has landed
a lot of your friends, if you stay
by it. Wouldn't it be better to
miss some of this stuff you have
come to think of as fun, and live
longer? There is no novelty in
drinking to you. You haven't an
appetite that cannot be checked,
but you will have if you stick to it
much longer. Why not quit and
take a chance at a new mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
living, especially when you know
absolutely that every health reason,
every future-prospect reason,
every atom of good sense in you,
tells you there is nothing to be
gained by keeping at it, and that
all may be lost?</p>

<p>Well, I pondered over that a long
time. I had watched miserable
wretches who had struggled to stay
on the waterwagon&mdash;sometimes
with amusement. I knew what
they had to stand if they tried to
associate with their former companions;
I knew the apparent difficulties
and the disadvantages of
this new mode of life. On the other
hand, I was convinced that, so far
as I was concerned, without trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to lay down a rule for any other
man, I would be an ass if I didn't
quit it immediately, while I was
well and all right, instead of waiting
until I had to quit on a doctor's
orders, or got to that stage when I
couldn't quit.</p>

<p>It was no easy thing to make the
decision. It is hard to change the
habits and associations of twenty
years! I had a good understanding
of myself. I was no hero. I liked
the fun of it, the companionship of
it, better than any one. I like my
friends and, I hope and think, they
like me. It seemed to me that I
needed it in my business, for I was
always dealing with men who did
drink.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>I wrestled with it for some
weeks. I thought it all out, up
one side and down the other. Then
I quit. Also I stayed quit. And
believe me, ladies and gentlemen
and all others present, it was no
fool of a job.</p>

<p>I have learned many things since
I went on the waterwagon for fair&mdash;many
things about my fellowmen
and many things about myself.
Most of these things radiate round
the innate hypocrisy of the human
being. All those that do not concern
his hypocrisy concern his lying&mdash;which,
I reckon, when you come
to stack them up together, amounts
to the same thing. I have learned
that I had been fooling myself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
that others had been fooling me.
I gathered experience every day.
And some of the things I have
learned I shall set down.</p>

<p>You have all known the man who
says he quit drinking and never
thought of drink again. He is a
liar. He doesn't exist. No man in
this world who had a daily habit
of drinking ever quit and never
thought of drinking again. Many
men, because they habitually lie to
themselves, think they have done
this; but they haven't. The fact
is, no man with a daily habit of
drinking ever quit and thought of
anything else than how good a
drink would taste and feel for a
time after he quit. He couldn't and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
he didn't. I don't care what any of
them say. I know.</p>

<p>Further, the man who tells you
he never takes a drink until five
o'clock in the afternoon, or three
o'clock in the afternoon, or only
drinks with his meals, or only
takes two or three drinks a day,
usually is a liar, too&mdash;not always,
but usually. There are some machine-like,
non-imaginative persons
who can do this&mdash;drink by rote or
by rule; but not many. Now I do
not say many men do not think
they drink this way, but most of
these men are simply fooling themselves.</p>

<p>Again, this proposition of cutting
down drinks to two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
a day is all rot. Of what use to
any person are two or three drinks
a day? I mean to any person who
drinks for the fun of it, as I did
and as most of my friends do yet.
What kind of a human being is he
who comes into a club and takes
one cocktail and no more?&mdash;or one
highball? He's worse, from any
view-point of sociability, than a
man who drinks a glass of water.
At least the man who drinks the
water isn't fooling himself or trying
to be part one thing and part
another. The way to quit drinking
is to quit drinking. That is all there
is to that. This paltering along
with two or three drinks a day is
mere cowardice. It is neither one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
thing nor the other. And I am here
to say, also, that nine out of every
ten men who say they only take
two or three drinks a day are liars,
just the same as the men who say
they quit and never think of it
again. They may not think they
are liars, or intend to be liars; but
they are liars just the same.</p>

<p>Well, as I may have intimated, I
quit drinking. I drank that last,
lingering Scotch highball&mdash;and
quit! I decided the no-liquor end
of it was the better end, and I took
that end.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />

WHEN I QUIT</h2>


<p>For purposes of comprehensive
record I have divided the various
stages of my waterwagoning
into these parts: the obsession
stage; the caramel stage; the pharisaical
stage, and the safe-and-sane
stage. I drank my Scotch highball
and went over to the club. The
crowd was there; I sat down at a
table and when somebody asked me
what I'd have I took a glass of
water. Several of my friends looked
inquiringly at me and one asked:
"On the wagon?" This attracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the attention of the entire group
to my glass of water. I came in for
a good deal of banter, mostly along
the line that it was time I went on
the wagon. This was varied with
predictions that I would stay on
from an hour to a day or so. I
didn't like that talk, but I bluffed
it out&mdash;weakly, to be sure. I said
I had decided it wouldn't do me any
harm to cool out a bit.</p>

<p>Next day, along about first-drink
time, I felt a craving for a highball.
I didn't take it. That evening I
went over to the club again. The
crowd was there. I was asked to
have a drink. This time I rather
defiantly ordered a glass of water.
The same jests were made, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
drank my water. On the third day
I was a bit shaky&mdash;sort of nervous.
I didn't feel like work. I couldn't
concentrate my mind on anything.
I kept thinking of various kinds of
drinks and how good they would
taste. I tried out the club. I may
have imagined it, but I thought my
old friends lacked interest in my
advent at the table. One of them
said: "Oh, for Heaven's sake, take
a drink! You've got a terrible
grouch on." I backed out.</p>

<p>I did have a grouch. I was sore
at everybody in the world. Also,
I kept thinking how much I would
like to have a drink. That was natural.
I had accustomed my system
to digest a certain amount of alcohol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
every day. I wasn't supplying
that alcohol. My system needed it
and howled for it. I knew a man
who had been a drunkard but who
had quit and who hadn't taken a
drink for twelve years. I discussed
the problem with him. He told me
an eminent specialist had told him
it takes eighteen months for a man
who has been a heavy drinker or
a steady drinker to get all the alcohol
out of his system. I hadn't been
a heavy drinker, but I had been a
steady drinker; and that information
gave me a cold chill. I thought
if I were to have this craving for
a drink every day for eighteen
months, surely I had let myself in
for a lovely task!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>I stuck for a week&mdash;for two
weeks&mdash;for three weeks. At the
end of that time my friends had
grown accustomed to this idiosyncrasy
and were making bets on how
long I would last. I didn't go
round where they were much. I
was as lonesome as a stray dog in
a strange alley. I had carefully
cultivated a large line of drinking
acquaintances and I hardly knew a
congenial person who didn't drink.
That was the hardest part of the
game. I wasn't fit company for
man or beast. I don't blame my
friends&mdash;not a bit. I was cross and
ugly and hypercritical and generally
nasty, and they passed me up.
However, the craving for liquor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
decreased to some degree. There
were some periods in the day when
I didn't think how good a drink
would taste, and did devote myself
to my work.</p>

<p>I discovered a few things. One
was that, no matter how much fun
I missed in the evening, I didn't
get up with a taste in my mouth.
I had no katzenjammers. After a
week or so I went to sleep easily
and slept like a child. Then the
caramel stage arrived. I acquired
a sudden craving for candy. I
had not eaten any candy for
years, for men who drink regularly
rarely take sweets. One day
I looked in a confectioner's window
and was irresistibly attracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
by a box of caramels. I went in
and bought it, and ate half a
dozen. They seemed to fill a long-felt
want. The sugar in them supplied
the stimulant that was lacking,
I suppose. Anyhow, they tasted
right good and were satisfactory;
and I kept a box of caramels
on my desk for several weeks and
ate a few each day. Also I began
to yell for ice cream and pie and
other sweets with my meals.</p>

<p>Along about this time I developed
the pharisaical stage. I looked
with a great pity on my friends who
persisted in drinking. I assumed
some little airs of superiority and
congratulated myself on my great
will-power that had enabled me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
quit drinking. They were steadily
drinking themselves to death. I
could see that plainly. There was
nothing else to it. I was a fine sample
of a full-blown prig. I went so
far as to explain the case to one or
two, and I got hooted at for my
pains; so I lapsed into my condition
of immense superiority and
said: "Oh, well, if they won't take
advice from me, who knows, let
them go along. Poor chaps, I am
afraid they are lost!"</p>

<p>It's a wonder somebody didn't
take an ax to me. I deserved it.
After lamenting&mdash;to myself&mdash;the
sad fates of my former companions
and pluming myself on my noble
course, I woke up one day and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
kicked myself round the park.
"Here!" I said. "You chump,
what business have you got putting
on airs about your non-drinking
and parading yourself round
here as a giant example of self-restraint?
Where do you get off
as a preacher&mdash;or a censor, or a reformer&mdash;in
this matter? Who appointed
you as the apostle of non-drinking?
Take a tumble to yourself
and close up!"</p>

<p>That was the beginning of the
safe-and-sane stage, which still persists.
It came about the end of the
second month. I had lost all desire
for liquor; and, though there were
times when I missed the sociability
of drinking fearfully, I was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
steady as a rock in my policy of
abstaining from drinks of all kinds.
Now it doesn't bother me at all. I
am riding jauntily on the wagon,
without a chance of falling off.</p>

<p>At the time I decided it was up
to me to stop this pharisaical foolishness,
I took a new view of
things; decided I wasn't so much,
after all; ceased reprobating my
friends who wanted to drink; had
no advice to offer, and stopped
pointing to myself as a heroic
young person who had accomplished
a gigantic task.</p>

<p>Friends had tolerated me. I wondered
that they had, for I was a sad
affair. Surely it was up to me to be
as tolerant as they had been, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
my new mode of life.
So I stopped foreboding and tried
to accustom my friends to my company
on a strictly water basis. The
attempt was not entirely successful.
I dropped out of a good many
gatherings where formerly I should
have been one of the bright and
shining lights. There are no two
ways about it&mdash;a man cannot drink
water in a company where others
are drinking highballs and get into
the game with any effectiveness.
Any person who quits drinking
may as well accept that as a fact;
and most persons will stop trying
after a time and seek new diversions;
or begin drinking again.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br /><br />

AFTER I QUIT</h2>


<p>I had a good lively tilt with John
Barleycorn, ranging over twenty
years. I know all about drinking.
I figured it this way: I have
about fifteen more good, productive
years in me. After that I shall lose
in efficiency, even if I keep my
health. Being selfish and perhaps
getting sensible, I desire the remaining
productive years of my
life to be years of the greatest
efficiency. Looking back over my
drinking years, I saw, if I was to
attain and keep that greatest efficiency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
that was my job, and that
it could not be complicated with
any booze-fighting whatsoever.</p>

<p>I decided that what I might lose
in the companionship and social
end of it I would gain in my own
personal increase in horsepower;
for I knew that though drinking
may have done me no harm, it certainly
did me no good, and that, if
persisted in, it surely would do me
harm in some way or other.</p>

<p>Sizing it up, one side against the
other, I conclude that it is better
for me not to drink. I find I have
much more time that I can devote
to my business; that I think more
clearly, feel better, do not make
any loose statements under the exhilaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
of alcohol, and keep my
mind on my number constantly.
The item of time is the surprising
item. It is astonishing how much
time you have to do things in that
formerly you used to drink in, with
the accompaniment of all the piffle
that goes with drinking! When
you are drinking you are never too
busy to take a drink and never too
busy not to stop. You are busy all
the time&mdash;but get nowhere. Work
is the curse of the drinking classes.</p>

<p>Any man who has been accustomed
to do the kind of drinking
I did for twenty years, who likes
the sociability and the companionship
of it, will find that the sudden
transition to a non-drinking life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
will leave him with a pretty dull
existence on his hands until he gets
reorganized. This is the depressing
part of it. You have nowhere
to go and nothing to do. Still,
though you may miss the fun of
the evening, you have all your
drinking friends lashed to the mast
in the morning.</p>
